      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>I was born in Peoria, but raised in Cedar Rapids Iowa.  So I'm a mid-western kid.  I like the prairie and being able to see the horizon.  I arrived here after graduating from The University of Iowa and now Illinois has been my home for most of my life.</p>
      <p>I've got a wife and two daughters.  I grew up with my mother and two sisters.  There's a whole lot of women in my life.  I'd tell you more about them, but this is all about me!</p>
      <p>Most of my interest you can see in the list at the bottom of the Keweenaw page.  Add to that volleyball, wood working, and sometimes reading.</p>
